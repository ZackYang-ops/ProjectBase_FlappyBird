# A Flappy-Bird Style Game
## General Notes
An effort to replicate a relevant mechanisms of the famous Flappy Bird game, built in Unity game engine.   
This is considered to be the base of my first 2D game project. Therefore most of the codes are designed to be re-usable and extensible.

## Usage
git clone https://github.com/ZackYang-ops/ProjectBase_FlappyBird.git, open a unity project and load the GameScene from asset. 
Built version of the game can be found under Bin directory.

## Status & Prerequisites
